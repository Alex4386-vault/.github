Welcome to the software junkyard of @Alex4386.  

These softwares are not actively maintained or abandoned and kept here for archival purposes. (or most of the time, i just forgot to delete my old repos)  
You can find my actual garbage of code on here and have fun making fun of me (unless it is licensed by [Junk Software Public License](https://github.com/Alex4386/JSPL).)  

Have Fun.
